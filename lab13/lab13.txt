13.1:
	a) None yet, because we haven't implemented any actual routes yet.
	b) Browser history is definitely better, because it makes things much more clean
		 by using headers instead of the literal URL to encode information.
	c) This is because the browser history doesn't directly affect the routes, while the hash
		 history does.

13.2:
	a) It maintains a componentDidUpdate state, which the commentBox component does not.
	b) It refreshes the values of the affected comments. By contrast, cancel just sends
		 you back to the home page without doing anything.
	c) It links via the react router to a different component (the commentBox component)
		 rather than linking to a totally different page of HTML.
