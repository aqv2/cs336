9.1
  a) It has made a bundle of all the necessary things so that we don't have to send
     a bunch of files and can instead send one. The only file of mine that is being
     loaded is bundle.js. It is 243 B in size.
  b) Babel compiles your javascript into equivalent prior versions of javascript so that
     you can write your code in the latest version, even if it is not fully supported
     by all browsers.
  c) No, because the server doesn't allow you too. I get a "cannot GET" message.
  d) It allows you to pre-process jsx files as they are loaded.

9.2
  a) dist/index.html looks exactly the same to me. As for bundle.js it is 2 B larger, apparently.
  b) It allows things to be more compact and compressed, which in turn makes things
     run faster.
  c) None of them, it's still just bundle.js being loaded.

9.3
  a) So 3001 (the dev one) automatically reloads when the code is edited and saved
     in contrast, 3000 stays working even if we have broken code.
  b) Definitely! With this way of doing things, you can make changes and fix bugs
     dynamically without having a huge amount of downtime every time there is a
     problem.
