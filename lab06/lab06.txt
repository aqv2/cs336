6.1
a) The browser can pretty much only directly test GET requests (you would have to use dev tools to test others).
  This is because that is all that browsers were designed to do: get and display information.
  Successful curl commands:
    curl -X POST localhost:3000/request -d '{"arg":"value"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    curl -X PUT localhost:3000/request -d '{"arg":"value"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    curl -X GET localhost:3000/request
    curl --head localhost:3000/request
    curl -x DELETE localhost:3000/request

b) The most appropriate route is a 404 file not found (even though you told us to do something different here).


6.2
a) Forms support the POST and GET methods.
b) The form data is being passed back to the server as JSON via a path that you handle in your server.
