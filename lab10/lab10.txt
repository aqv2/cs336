10.1
	a) Mongo is much more open, free, and decentralized. This makes sense, because it does not have a schema defining the overall structure of everything. SQL is better if you need that structure, but if you are dealing with a constantly changing database, it is better to have the flexibility of mongodb.
	b) Well, if it were run locally, this machine would have to be up and running for that database to be accessed. As such, this would NOT work for a production environment (unless, of course, you are running it on an always-on server). It would be faster, though, because accessing data locally is always faster than accessing it via the internet.
	c) You could not, because mLab only provides you a half gig of space to work with, which would be hugely insufficient for any sort of production database that cares about data persistence.
	
10.2
	a) I just used npm run dev for this project and it worked just fine. There was no appreciable difference that I could discern between them.
	b) What happens is the comment disappears from the web app when it is manually deleted from the database with mLab's web UI.
	c) I would say NoSQL, because there is just less overhead, and with an application this simple, it is not like your documents are going to get super complicated in such a way that the added structure of a SQL database would be beneficial.
